Their intensity would be, by several orders of magnitude, higher than those of the presently operating light sources, in the particularly interesting gamma-ray energy domain reaching up to 400 MeV. In this energy domain, the high-intensity photon beams can be used to produce secondary beams of polarised electrons, polarised",0

Particle physicists should be aware that the Concordance model may have to be changed. They should also be aware that there is extreme reluctance amongst many cosmologists to acknowledge the true level of the crisis in cosmology. As well as numerous ‘tensions’, such as the Hubble tension, there are also important philosophical difficulties in Concordance cosmology such as the ’coincidence problem’ and singularity problems.

Observations of CMB temperature fluctuations have played a pivotal role in establishing the standard cosmological model and provide insights into the origin of structure, the density of baryons, dark matter, and dark energy, the number of neutrino species, and the global properties of spacetime. Many remaining questions about the Universe can best be answered",411

The hallmark way to search for electroweakinos in natural supersymmetry at the LHC involves the trilepton plus missing energy (E / T ) final state. This approach assumes an electroweakino mass hierarchy that allows for cascade decays leading to a final state of W ± Z 0 plus E/ T . There are, however, situations when that decay pattern may not exist, such as when a chargino is the lightest electroweakino and the lightest supersymmetric particle is the gravitino.

Land, Samuel Young, Tanner Kaptanoglu, Meng Luo, Amanda Bacon, and Joshua R. Klein University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA Spectral photon sorting with dichroic filters is realized with the dichroicon device, which diverts long and short wavelength photons to separate PMTs with minimal photon loss. This technique allows a detector to identify a pure population of long-wavelength Cherenkov photons outside of the scintillator spectrum. Identification of Cherenkov photons in a bright liquid scintillator is a powerful tool for background rejection, as Cherenkov photons carry directional information,",1183

This is generally done using acrylic and/or nylon barriers, whose own intrinsic activity can also lead to substantial cuts to the fiducial detection volume for a number of low energy (~MeV) studies. Such barrier constructions also become increasingly difficult and expensive for larger detector volumes, with JUNO already pushing the boundaries",1184

A unique program of direct measurements of electromagnetic dipole moments of strange and charm bary- ons, and ultimately beauty baryons",1410
