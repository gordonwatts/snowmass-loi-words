A muon collider has a combination of requirements that are well beyond the limit of any existing target technology.

Earlier experimentalists using normal conducting S-band and L-band accelerators have mitigated these effects by steering the beam optimally through the cavities while watching downstream imaging screens [2] or streak camera images [3]. One can even tune the wakefields to cancel some of the effects in a few normal conducting L-band structures by not centering the beam on a screen or BPM,235

As a central tracking detector a time projection chamber with an MPGD-based readout is a very promising choice. The Linear Collider TPC (LCTPC) collaboration is working on designing such a detector taking into account the unique characteristics and requirements of experiments at a high energy e+e- -collider.

From the detection of the fast component (∼ns time scale) of the scintillation to provide trigger and precise information on the starting time of the event, to the collection of amplified optical signals from the ionisation charges to either image or identify particle types, scintillation light has been central to time projection chambers (TPCs).

Despite recent progress, the realization of a stable, VUV-quenched gain, scintillation-capable, 10-15 bar TPC remains elusive. This LOI discusses pathways toward this this goal. TPCs using argon-based gas mixtures typically employ avalanche gain to amplify signals from drifting charge. In this process, electrons entering a region of large electric field are multiplied through ionizing collisions to enhance the detectable signal above electronic noise on the readout channel [18]. To obtain stable gain rather than a runaway avalanche (or spark), a quench gas is added,",1139

This is especially important when pursuing physics at the MeV scale where the anti-correlation between the energy deposited in scintillation and ionization leads to an energy smearing without the accurate utilization of both signals. In the context of large LArTPCs, accurate measurements of the scintillation light would require large amounts of photo-cathode coverage. To overcome this we propose the use of photo-ionizing dopants which aim to convert the isotropic scintillation light into directional ionization charge. This would have three benefits",1167

Such barrier constructions also become increasingly difficult and expensive for larger detector volumes, with JUNO already pushing the boundaries of what might be achievable. The SLIPS concept is to do away with such physical barriers entirely by instead mounting PMTs on the bottom of a wide cavity and covering them with a distillable, lipophobic liquid, above which a less dense scintillator is layered. Liquids such as various ethylene glycols are good candidates for the bottom layer as they provide a",1178

This allows for directional and particle ID information while also maintaining good energy resolution. Such an approach is highly economical (i.e. small compared to other experimental costs) and can be readily applied to existing and planned large-scale liquid scintillator instruments without the need of additional hardware development and installation. Using this technique, we have explicitly demonstrated Cherenkov separation on a bench-top scale, showing clear directionality, for electron energies extending below 1 MeV. Timing measurements were made using a 90Sr source",1179

The principle solubilisation mechanism is believed to be the formation of an association between OH groups in the Te compounds and DDA, effectively adding a long carbon tail to the compounds, thereby promoting solubility in LAB and inhibiting further oligomerisation. The de-protonation of the acidic oligomers by the amine has the added benefit of reducing the fluorescence quenching in the scintillator. Based on observations of the light yield, the optimal molar ratio of DDA to Te appears to be very close to 0.5:1. Neutralisation and solubilisation of the precursor compounds in LAB can be accomplished by first adding",1180
