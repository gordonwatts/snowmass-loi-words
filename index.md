# Snowmass Letters of Interest

Over 1500 LOI's were submitted to the [Snowmass 2021](https://snowmass21.org/) process. At the University of Washington we are hard at work getting ready for the summer meeting (COVID allowing...) - and I wanted to take a look at all the incoming LOI's. The 1500 number was unexpected - I did not think that many would show up!

The LOI's here are a copy - freely downloaded. The official repository can be found from the [main website](https://snowmass21.org/). The snapshot in this data was taking just as the LOI process closed. All analysis can be found in [this github repository](https://github.com/gordonwatts/snowmass-loi-words). Feel free to submit pull requests!
