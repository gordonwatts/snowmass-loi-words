LQCD is a regularization of continuum QCD using a discretized four-dimensional spacetime; it contains a small number of natural parameters, the strong coupling constant and quark masses. Unlike continuum QCD, LQCD works in Euclidean spacetime (rather than Minkowski), and the coupling and quark masses can be set differently than those in our universe. The theory contains two scales that are absent in continuum QCD, one ultraviolet (the lattice spacing a) and one infrared (the spatial extent of the box L); this"}, {"file": "loi-text/EF/SNOWMASS21-EF6_EF0-TF5_TF0_Jian-Hui_Zhang-151.txt", "title": "Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD", "abstract": "LaMET provides an alternative formulation in which the same parton physics can be obtained from matrix elements of time-independent operators in infinite-momentum hadrons.

In the context of large LArTPCs, accurate measurements of the scintillation light would require large amounts of photo-cathode coverage.
